<h2> More About Me</h2>

    <li> <b> Adjectives:</b> Witty, Studious, Athletic- These are the key parts of my personality, and I feel that through each of these you can see a different section of who I am.

    <li> <b>Favorite Subject(s):</b> STEM classes- The STEM classes are my favorite because they are always very logical and reasoned, and it is easy to understand how you solve each of the problems and attain each solution. 
    <li> <b>Activities/Hobbies:</b> Outside of school I swim and play lots of sports recreationally, additionally I play the clarinet and am a hella good chef.

<h2> Present and Future (Goals) </h2>
  <ol>
<!-- This creates an ordered list. -->
     <li> <b> Physical Goal: </b> This year, I would like to be able to swim a 2:00.00 in my 200 IM. I have been working towards this time for the past few years, and it would be great if I could achieve this time. I think I can do this by practicing hard each day and by working hard in the meets as well. 
     <li> <b> Emotional Goal: </b> I wish that, for just one second, I can feel anything other than the cold, dark abyss that is Artie. Each day, I look to him for support, and in return, I get a cold shoulder with a side of sassy remarks. Hopefully someday this year, he will realize how much I mean to him, and the relationship will change. 
     <li> <b> Social Goal: </b> This year, I hope to have more meaningful conversations with my freinds and family members. I can do this by talking to them more and taking the time that I spend with them more seriously.
